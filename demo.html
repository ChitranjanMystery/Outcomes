    <h1>Can Machine think ?</h1>
    <p>I would say that machines can simulate human thought processes through advanced algorithms and computational power, but they do not have the same consciousness or cognitive abilities as humans.
    Therefore, it is unlikely that machines can truly "think" in the same way that humans do</p>
